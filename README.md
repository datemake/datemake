# UpDate

UpDate is a fun online app to help people come up with creative date ideas.

## Features

The site is made up of the following main pages:
* a landing page (where users can register and log in) 
* a search page (where users can search for dates by their location and by tags such as 'romantic', 'nature', 'silly')
* a date page (where users can view the date they selected from the search results)
* a reviews page (actually part of the date page; it contains reviews of the specific date)
* a profile page (the user's profile which shows the dates they have made and the dates they have reviewed)
* an extensive wizard form (where the user can create a date)




## Dates

Each date contains three parts: a main activity, a food experience, and a 'memory-maker' (which is the unique part of the date that sets it apart from other dates)

Users can design dates to have a theme, such as a Japanese themed date that includes dinner at a Ramen Shop and a trip to a karaoke bar, or they can design the date to be connected to a more obvious idea such as 'romantic' or 'outdoors'.

## Technology

The site was made using React (including the new React hooks), Redux, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. It also relies on the Google Places API to get data about places (including addresses and photos) and it uses Firebase for authentication and for image uploading/storage.

## Domain

The website is hosted at https://up-date.love/.
